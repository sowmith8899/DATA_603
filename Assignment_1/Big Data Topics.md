### Big Data with example and types :
- Bigdata can be described as process of processing data which is huge, complex and difficult to process using regular traditional methods , data can be either structured or unstructured.
- Bigdata today is used in various sectors such as in banking,healthcare,online media platforms(Netfilx,Hulu,etc) and many more areas
- Types of Big data :
  - Structured: Data which is organised with dimensions and easy to process
  - Un Structured Data: Raw data which is not at all organised and difficult to process 
  - Semi Structured Data : This can be considered as a combination of both above
  - Batch Data : Here the data is collected over the time and will be sent for processing whole as a batch
  - Streaming data : Here the data will be obtained from the source simultaneously the data fetched will be processed real time.
  - Graph data : This is current emerging type of data analysis which helps us to understand the complex relations between data in any network or tree of data.

### 6 ‘V’s of Big Data :
- Volume : The name Big data itself is saying that we get a huge volume of data. We will be processing it with big data tools so that it will be easy for us to analyse even the huge amount of data
- Vareity : Big data usually contains a wide range of data formats such as audio,video,images,text etc
- Velocity : In Big data , the data will be recieved very fast as they will be fetched from realtime data flow sources such as machines , social media etc
- Veracity : This refers to the inconsistencies in the data which we ideally needs to be process and make them cleaned. 
- Value : This refers to the importance or intention of an unprocessed data which we need to convert them as per our requirements and bring some significance to the data
- Variability : Obtaining data in a structured format even though we are handling it under inconsistant environment.

### Phases of Big Data analysis :
- Data Acquisition and Recording : We acquire data from various sources where we could see few areas of data which is not useful for the analysis which needs to be filtered out.
- Information Extraction and Cleaning : As we discussed above , we need to extract the data which is usefull to us and must need to clean accordingly where we need to handle the missing values , inconsistent data types
- Data Integration, Aggregation, and Representation : Similar data in the whole system needs to be identified and then needed to be integrated which helps us to analysing. The similar data which is analysed can be represented in many ways such as box graphs, pie charts ,histogram etc
- Query Processing, Data Modeling, and Analysis : Query processing is nothing but applying filters or making conditions to our data that we can make them to fetch our requirement
- Interpretation : After whole process of processing data , we need to make sure and verify the reuslts that it provided precise results.

### Challenges in Big Data analysis :
- Heterogeneity and Incompleteness : We even applying the data cleaning and analysing techniques we could expect some minute amount of inconsistent data which may create mess in our verdict of analysis sometimes.
- Storage / Scale : We could see huge amount of data is geting stored from various platforms, the biggest challenge is storing that huge data it could be bit more harder if we recieve data in different formats.
- Processing : The process of reading, converting, extracting, and structuring relevant data from raw data is known as big data processing. It is still difficult to enter data and create unified forms.
- Security / Privacy : Today managing data confidentiality is a huge task. Even though we try to protect the data , there was huge risk of theft by cyber criminals.
